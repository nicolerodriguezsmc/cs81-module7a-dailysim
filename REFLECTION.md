The following are my reflections:

* What was your approach to designing the schedule?
  I designed the schedule by choosing activities that reflect my daily life. My favorite is petting my cat.

* What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
  One challenge was making sure each activity displayed at the correct time. Using setTimeout made it easier than expected to add a delay to each activity.

* What does this assignment teach you about async code?
  This assignment taught me how asynchronous code can handle tasks that occur at different times. It makes it autonomous from synchronous code, which runs in order, line by line. 

* What creative element did you add?
  I added a Flash mob activity that appears at a random time during the day. It was difficult to figure out how to generate random numbers, but once figured out adds unpredictability.

* How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
  The project simulates real world schedules by showing activities in a timed sequence. Like real life, each activity takes a certain amount of time. Unlike real life, it does not    include unpredictable events, unpredictable timings, and an unpredictable order.
